# Telecom Company Churn Analysis 📞

Hi there! 👋

This project aims to analyze customer churn for a telecom company using various data analysis techniques in python. 🐍

Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stop using a company's products or services over a given period of time. It is a key metric for businesses to measure their customer retention and loyalty. 📊

In this project, we will explore the factors that influence customer churn and build a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to churn. 🔮

## Data Analysis 📈

We perform both univariate and bivariate analysis on the dataset to understand the distribution of individual variables and the relationship between pairs of variables. 🧮

During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process, we use Python to remove null values and handle missing data. We also address the issue of imbalanced data by upscaling and downscaling the dataset. 🔧

We use various visualization tools such as histograms, boxplots, bar charts, and heatmaps to display our findings and insights. 📊

## Data Preprocessing 🧹

As part of the preprocessing step, we convert numerical variables to categorical values. We also use one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into a format that can be used in machine learning models. 🧬

We also perform feature engineering and feature selection to create new variables and select the most relevant ones for our model. 🔬

## Model Building and Evaluation 🏗️

We use a random forest classifier to build our predictive model. To handle imbalanced data, we use the SMOTEENN technique to balance the dataset. 🌲

We evaluate our model using a confusion matrix and calculate the F1 score to measure its performance. 📝

We also use cross-validation and grid search to tune our model's hyperparameters and optimize its accuracy. 🔧

## Conclusion and Recommendations 💡

We summarize our findings and provide some recommendations for the telecom company to reduce customer churn and increase customer satisfaction. 🙌

We also discuss the limitations of our analysis and suggest some future directions for improvement. 🚀

## How to Run This Project 🏃‍♂️

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. You can also download the book data from this link and place it in the data folder. 📁

Then, follow the instructions in the notebook and enjoy the analysis! 😊
